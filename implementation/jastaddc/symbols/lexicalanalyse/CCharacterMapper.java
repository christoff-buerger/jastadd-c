/**
* The mapper is used for a C front end developed with JastAdd.
*
* The mapper realizes translation phase 5 :
*  - each source character set member and escape sequence in character
*    constants and string literals is converted to the corresponding member
*    of the execution character set
* 
* It extends beaver's Scanner class, so it can be used as scanner for
* a beaver parser. It's constructor accepts a beaver scanner,
* which the CCharacterMapper will use to recognize lexems. It only checks
* for string literal lexem and character constant token (all other token
* are just forwarded) and transforms their value to the execution
* character set before forwarding them.
* 
* To perform this task the CCharacterMapper is using a JFlex generated
* helper class, the {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CCharacterMapper_ CCharacterMapper_}, which
* can be treated like an inner class of the CCharacterMapper.
* 
* TODO : A much better solution would be the following, which can't be done as
* unfortunately JFlex doesn't allow to have an arbitrary type of objects as
* input stream. In this case the mapper could be generated using a JFlex
* specification instead of a manual implementation using a lexer generated
* by a JFlex specification.
