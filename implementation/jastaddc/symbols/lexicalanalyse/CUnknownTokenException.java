/**
 * CUnknownTokenException's are thrown, if while lexing unknown lexems are
 * encountered. It's important to distinguish this type of error while parsing
 * from others, because it's the only possible lexical error caused by faulty
 * source code. Other errors during the lexical analyze are technical based,
 * like trying to read not existing source code files, not being allowed to
 * read a source code file, buffer problem etc. Exceptions like this should
 * never be instances of CUnknownTokenException, so this class is final.<br>
 * <br>
 * Technical based exceptions are represented by {@link java.io.IOException}s.
