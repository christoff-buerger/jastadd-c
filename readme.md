# Documentation

The original author of this _C99_ compiler was Christoff Bürger. The project was his master thesis for the degree of _Dipl.-Inf._. It was finished in September 2008 and graded with the best possible grade (_very good_, 1.0). The supervisors were Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Uwe Aßmann (main supervisor, _Chair of Software Technology_, _Fakulät Informatik_, _Technische Universität Dresden_) and Professor Görel Hedin (_Department of Computer Science_, _LTH_, _Lund University_). Christoff's thesis documents _JastAdd-C's_ implementation. In particular the general modularisation and semantic analyses concepts presented in the thesis are a prerequisite to understand _JastAdd-C's_ implementation.
