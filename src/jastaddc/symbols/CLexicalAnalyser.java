/**
 * This class represents and executes all lexical tasks of an C99 compiler.
 * It's phases correspond to the translation phases of the C99 standard (5.1.1.2).
 * 
 * The lexical tasks are the translation phases 1 to 7 (of phase 7 only parts).
 * For each translation phase of the standard this C99 lexer executes a
 * corresponding component representing and executing the semantics of this phase :
 *  1) Mapping of physical source file characters and translation of trigraphs.
 *     The {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CSourceReader CSourceReader}-class is used to do so.
 *  2) Concatenation of spliced lines. The {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CSplicer CSplicer}-
 *     class is used to do so.
 *  3) Recognition of preprocessor token. Preprocessing is not done using this
 *     C99 lexer, but the preprocessing token also occuring to the parser are
 *     recognized (this are the preprocessing token which are in translation
 *     phase 7 converted into token; token are all symbols of the C99 grammar).
 *     The {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CLexer CLexer} is used to recognize C99 grammar symbols.
 *  4) Processing of preprocessor directives. <b>Not done here<b>.
 *  5) Transformation of source character set members and escape sequences. The
 *     {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CCharacterMapper CCharacterMapper} is used to perform this task.
 *  6) Concatenation of adjacent string literal token. The
 *     {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CStringLiteralConcatenator CStringLiteralConcatenator} is used
 *     to perform this task.
 *  7) Converting preprocessor token to token. The {@link jastaddc.symbols.lexicalanalyse.CLexer CLexer} is
 *     used to recognize C99 grammar symbols and it is already executed in this
 *     C99 lexer's phase 3, which corresponds to translation phase 3 of the standard.
